We build separate projects for different modules to properly organize and resuse our code.
The url consists of http://domain/controller/actionMethod/id. For each controller we can have many action methods
By default we are viewing the index action method under home controller. We can change this in program.cs.
In the controller class, action methods, return View(); will return the view with corresponding method name.
We can also specify the view we want to return by using return View("test"); which will return Test.cshtml. Not case sensitive.

ApplicationCore is the base project for the application
Entities in ApplicationCore will have objects that represent our DB tables
Models -> will have objects that represent your UI


Dapper is from StackOverflow

Services -> Domain/BUsiness Logic
e.g. GetJobById , Send Confirmation Email, Get All jobs

Controller => Services => Repositories(using EF Core or Dapper or ADO.NET ) -> Database
