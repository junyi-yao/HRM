We build separate projects for different modules to properly organize and resuse our code.
The url consists of http://domain/controller/actionMethod/id. For each controller we can have many action methods
By default we are viewing the index action method under home controller. We can change this in program.cs.
In the controller class, action methods, return View(); will return the view with corresponding method name.
We can also specify the view we want to return by using return View("test"); which will return Test.cshtml. Not case sensitive.
